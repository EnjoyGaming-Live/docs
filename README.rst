`Read the Docs`_ simplifies software documentation
by building, versioning, and hosting of your docs, automatically.
This enables many "docs like code" workflows,
keeping your code & documentation as close as possible.

Never out of sync |:arrows_counterclockwise:|
    Whenever you push code to your favorite version control system,
    whether that is Git or Mercurial,
    Read the Docs will automatically build your docs
    so your code and documentation are always up-to-date.
